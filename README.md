The purpose of the project is to have client-to-client or peer-to-peer TCP connections for direct communication without any intervening router. Since the clients, or peers, have no knowledge of their respective IP addresses, each TCPServerRouter has in its routing tables the necessary routing information for all the clients that are connected to it. This sets up the necessary connections so that the nodes can transmit files of any type. We then transfer different File types (Audio, Text, PNG, etc) and gather transfer, download, and localization times to analyze the performance of the system. We will analyze and then use this data to visualize and expand on our understanding of the concepts of Parallel Distributed Systems.
